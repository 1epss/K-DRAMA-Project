I think 045. 426 is probably just another mistake, while 045 was actually checked after the Special Round. You may say 045 died in honeycombs, but I disagree. People like 045 and 092 made it to Marbles (excluding 345). Also, people like 225 and 236, etc. have still not been confirmed to have survived until Marbles, since Team 6 and Team 8 got replaced for some reason. Also, 413 has glasses, but 414 doesn't.

Because of this, let us change the people. There is going to be 5 major characters, 14 minor characters, and 1 supporting character. The 5 major characters are Deok-su, Mi-nyeo, Sae-byeok, Gi-hun, and Sang-woo. The 14 minor characters are everyone in Team 8 and 4 members of Team 6. Let's say these four are 183, 230, 236, and 092.

      "(SPOILERS)\n",
      "In the depressing episode, 6, we know that Sang-Woo betrayed Ali in the marbles game after they became partners. Ali discovered that his sack was filled with pebbles, and Sang-Woo turned in the 20 marbles. We then experience Ali's death. But the thing is, we only see the guard pointing the gun to his head. It then cuts to Sang-Woo, and we hear a gunshot. But we never actually see Ali's death. Much like Il-nam, who didn't actually die. Even though we heard a gunshot, and noticed the guard about to shoot him, it cut to Gi-Hun. Later revealing that Il-nam was never actually shot, as he was seen in the hospital in episode 9. 001 & 199's deaths were the only off screen deaths. In conclusion, there's a chance that Ali did actually survive, and maybe he was with Il-nam. Working for the game perhaps. Even though there's a small chance he did actually survive, it's only a theory.\n",
      "Now, for 067. In episode 8, we know Kang Sae-byeok experienced a tragic death, after being impaled by a shattered piece of glass in the \"Glass Stepping Stones\" game. Later on, Sang-Woo finishes her death by slitting her throat while Gi-hun tried to get staff's help for her. It was a very sad and tragic moment for viewers. But, maybe she's still alive. Chances are very tiny however. We notice that the guards carry out her coffin, and put her in it. However, like all deaths, it announces the player's death. For example, \"Player 246, Eliminated\" after their death. It never announced Sae-byeok's death, even though the guards carried out her coffin instantly after her death. You'd think they would announce it, but they didn't. Possibly, she was treated by one of the doctors. And maybe, she's still alive. Who knows, in season 2 she could come back and be a worker. Maybe she'll betray people, as there was already a lot of plot twists in season 1. This chance is very small however, since she was already in unbearable pain before she died, indicating she would die slowly anyway. \n",

      "Interest in Squid Game has been dwindling in recent months, with the series being overtaken by other shows such as ''All of Us Are Dead'' and a second season very far from the horizon. As such, activity on the wiki has been declining, and the admin decision to nuke minor character off the wiki is just putting a neat bow on the coffin.\n",
      "If you look through the recent changes at any given moment, the large majority of edits are occurring on minor character pages. This is a week AFTER the initial decision to delete said pages from the wiki and the mass exodus it caused, and the reason it's happening is because it's the only direction the wiki can expand. The main articles on episodes, actors, and major characters are all fleshed out with little to add, and the only significant progress that can be made now is on pages for bit players.\n",
      "Before you go \"there's a list of minor characters page, dummy\", the reason people aren't pooling their edits into it is because it's figuratively putting all your eggs in one basket. The page is supposed to contain all of the relevant information for over 300 individuals, which it doesn't do efficiently at all. I doubt most of the people on here can be arsed to find their character on the page and edit it, and even if they try there's nothing to do but add info to a badly formatted system covering only the most basic of appearance info.\n",
      "The page is about as disorganized as any of the minor character pages ever were, none of the promised fixes to the format have come as far as I can see, and it's already the second largest page on the wiki in its incomplete form. There's simply no balance that can be struck between having it be thorough and ridiculously large, because it's already the latter one without being the former.\n",
      "The main complaint against minor character pages I've seen is that they're repetitive and badly written, but the edits going on right now are the very solution to that. The main attraction behind these pages are the appearance trivia and plot errors they showcase surrounding the brief appearances the characters make, which they do more effectively than the big list has done so far. The community has been actively filling out and self-improving the minor pages that are being remade on the wiki, and it will probably keep up until they are all at the same quality that the other bigger pages on the wiki are at. It's easy to complain that the pages are barren when you're actively deleting images and reverting expansions people are making for the pages.\n",
      "And the argument that the pages are useless or too insignificant to be included is also a bad argument because of what I said above, and because tons of people find the minor details that occur with these characters interesting. Not everyone's here to read up on Seong Gi-hun or Cho Sang-woo. Plus omitting confirmed information like that just goes against the point of wikis in general, which is cataloguing all credible information related to a topic. Anything under the sun that can be confirmed canon ought to be fair game, and trying to gatekeep what information is important enough to add and streamlining the wiki by removing \"unimportant\" info goes against the very purpose of having one, and is opposite of what should be happening right now.\n",
      "You can take this post down if you want and silence the dissenters, but the bottom line is that a large chunk of the userbase is against the admin decision, which has caused the wiki to take a hit in quality and stifled editing activity and frankly doesn't improve things at all. And committing to a subpar roadmap for the future like this will be detrimental to the wiki and everyone involved in it.\n",

There are so much vandalism, so many errors, many mistranslated pages, many unfinished pages, a lot of incorrect grammar, and too much to deal with. I think we all know about the tragedy that happened last night. 200 pages were deleted, and so many pages were voted for deletion. Most of this happened in the characters page, and I might have to say that it was my fault. A week ago, I completely just decided to have fun with the characters page and make an entire revamp. But after a day, I decided to bring it back to normal. I left a couple of changes untouched, which vandals decided to use it to their biggest power. They changed those untouched changes back, ruining the characters page and deleting so many innocent pages. More to talk about, Squid Game is dead. Name anybody who actually still really cares about it and uses it for content? Nobody. MrBeast made his own, and after that everything just when back to normal. There are so many legendary posters who used to be on here, and now they are all gone. Even I am slowly starting to quit, and I always edit. But now it is official, I am leaving. I appreciate people who still stay on this Wiki, but it is time to stop. All of this nonsense is dead. I have nothing left to explore. There are so many pages we never made. So out of all of this glory, this wiki should stop. I had so much fun and will keep so many memories of this wiki, but that will not stop me. So after all of what I said, and all the rants I made, it should be clear. This wiki should be left abandoned and never touched ever again. Leave it in all of its glory. Even if some if it is screwed up.\n",

Unnamed masked Solider during Dalgona he checked to see if Player 119 aka No Sang-hun craved his Umbrella correctly which he faiked however he respectfully fought back against the masked man and likely took his life as a needle stab to the eye is likely breaking the skull so he likely died.\n",
      "3. Masked manager behind computer in control room he was the last person who was known about the Organ trafficking scheme who died off screen likely by a solider who followed the rules this manager who died was likely a criminal in Poverty who robbed a gas station or even a corporate office building by eliminating major security footage in squid game building and he was likely young like 23 so he died off screen definitely.\n",

Player 276 he was the other kind hearted and strong noble man from Pakistan who Ali got to join Gi-hun and Sang-woo tug of war team and he was in the next round marbles and lost to someone else off screen he even chose Umbrella like Gi-hun did in Dalgona and survived and died but was likely smiling about playing a fun childhood game so he rested peacefully.\n",

Player 196 he was paired up with best friend and partner Player 244 aka the pastor he died off screen but his dead body is shown when Sae-byeok is walking by in marble arena he was a member of Sang-woo and Gi-hun tug of war team and allied with them personally didn't care for this guy as he seemed kinda arrogant or to sleazy to me he was just alright so didn't think much of him.\n",

Player 303 he was one of Jang deok-su gang buddies he was a major member of his team but was killed off screen personally likely because he had less lines then the likes of 278 or 040 but still we can't be sure he died since has number was announced as eliminated but my best guess is he paired up with someone and they both didn't finish the game and were both excuted as a result of that.\n",
      "7. Unnamed waiter Hwang Jun-ho knocks out he wasn't very smart since he got knocked out by the good cop himself and he was likely killed by front man for 2 reasons no mask on means die now and was also excuted to protect his borther so he could keep the serach going.\n",

These type of people are clearly not showing any effort on the wiki. Not to mention, this also goes against the guidelines of the wiki. People who do this are not even following the rules. It just goes to show that no one cares about what we do in this fandom. I think everyone should take this seriously and we need to put an end to this bullcrap now! \n",

Most of the time, he can be easily challenged, arrogant, thoughtful, and entertaining. He would always ask for money from his parents and that would annoy them a lot. His parents see Sang Ho as a disappointment and lazy. When Sang-Ho would try to impress his parents with his gaming skills, they wouldn't be interested and would just make them even more disappointed. Sang Ho actions would finally cost him and would cause his parents to finally kick him out of the house for good. After this, he would be homeless and live on a subway. That is when \"The Salesman\" saw him and convinced Sang-Ho to compete in Squid Game.\n",

      "How does business man knows about literally every single players' credit history (including a gang member like Jang Deok-su)? Aren't people's credit histories kept strictly confidential?\n",
      "How did businessman play Ddakji with Deok-su, let alone knowing about his debt in the first place? Wouldn't that make the businessman a witness of the gang's secret affair, and won't he be targeted by gangsters in order to keep things secret?\n",
      "When people go missing and/or die, usually there will be an investigation and a death warrant issued. Since 456 people go missing each year during an annual Squid Game, wouldn't that raise concern among police officers? Most players are in heavy debt, so it is highly likely that the police will look for them. In episode 2, Gi-hun hauled his ass to the local police station after the game was terminated and asked police officers to intervene, but none of them took him seriously, with an exception of Jun-ho, a police officer whose brother went missing after signing up for the 28th Squid Game. If there are Squid Games annually, then there's a probability that some games from the previous years were terminated as well, and some players snitched to the police. If more than one people are saying the same description of the event, wouldn't the police start to take the complaints seriously, no matter how absurd the story is?\n",
      "Where do Squid Game officials accumulate so many money from? Surely not from the organ harvesting, because that was done by corrupt guards for their personal gains, not for the game. Is there someone funding them?\n",
      "We all know the Squid Game was created and is being maintained by rich people for personal entertainment. But is there any chance that government official is also among those rich people who are putting up Squid Game? For political or economic stability?\n",
      "Are players who managed to win a Squid Game allowed to enter the next one?\n",
      "Do each Squid Games have same game each year? With the second season officially coming up, it is likely that there will be different games, but we have no idea about contents of the game from the previous Squid Games as of now.\n",
      "Are there any game shows of death like Squid Game in other countries?\n",
      "Are there any Squid Game in which no player survived, players voted to end the game session and the Squid Game couldn't continue on for some reason, or in rare case, more than one player won? The last one is very difficult, but is not impossible, because it is a team game, and for example, 4 players survived the fifth round, and is divided in the team of two in the final round, and one pair successfully emerged victorious.\n",
      "How do Squid Game officials recruit employees (i.e. guards and waiters)? Does the businessman recruit random people from the street in the same way he recruits player? And also, guards are seemingly expert with firearms, so the businessman may be very selective in the \"hiring process\", as he would want someone with experience of wielding guns to be the guards.\n",
      "How did Hwang In-ho (a.k.a. the Front Man) became the head of masked guards? How can someone willingly work for the very people who tried to kill him, and how and why did the Squid Game officials recruit him? Aside from being a winner of the 28th Squid Game, what is so significant about him that Squid Game officials wanted him as the leader of masked men?\n",
      "Just thought about these when I was watching the show. If those masked guards are constantly spying on not only players, but also the entire population of the country, and police can't do anything about it (or even worse, the government knows about it and deliberately letting it happen), then the entire thing sounds dystopian all of sudden.\n",

      "Hi, everyone. Today I will be showing you my opinion-based probability comparison of the Squid Game characters that people less to most likely hate. This will be only judged based on the character(including side characters) actions on the show and the fanfiction that I made.\n",
      "But before we do that, I want to thank everyone for the support on my recent fanfiction that I made. You guys are so awesome and I'm looking forward to making the next one. \n",
      "Inspiration:\n",
      "Abdul Ali/Hated by 0.1% of the fans: This character had to be the nicest person on the show. After winning the game of Marbles, he started to get nicer as the show progressed. In the end, Gi-hun and Ali managed to win Squid Game together. I'm glad that he is still alive in my fanfiction. Gi-hun and Ali will definitely work together to take down the death games.\n",
      "Seong Gi-Hun/Hated by 0.2% of the fans: He is the main character of the series. I felt bad for him because he lost his childhood friend and Sae-byeok. At least he was able to have one friend alive. I hope Gi-hun and Ali get their vengeance for their fallen friends in Season 2.\n",
      "Kang Sae-Byeok/Hated by 0.2% of the fans: She is a North Korean defector that joined the Squid Game to gain money to get her brother out of the orphanage and her mother out of North Korea. Her moments on the show were amazing. The way she died was very sad. None of the facilities at the games didn't try to help Sae-byeok and she died due to blood loss.\n",
      "Cho Sang-Woo/Hated by 0.3% of the fans: Many people loved him for what he did to Ali in the marbles game. He sacrificed himself just so Ali could live and make it to the finals. I'm glad I made him the hero in my fanfiction and most people can thank me for that. \n",
      "Seong Ga-Yeong/Hated by 0.5% of the fans: Seong Gi-Hun's daughter may not have gotten a lot of screen time on the show, but she was very adorable. Seong Gi-Hun is lucky to have such a nice daughter. I hope she makes another appearance in Season 2.\n",
      "Ji-Yeong/Hated by 0.8% of the fans: Similar to what Cho Sang-woo did, she sacrificed herself just so that Kang Sae-Byeok could live and make it to the finals. It's very devastating that she had a sad backstory and most people probably cried seeing her get shot by one of the soldiers. We will always honour her for what she did for Kang Sae-Byeok.\n",
      "Sang-Woo's Mother/Hated by 1% of the fans: It was very sad that she didn't know the situation his son was in. If she would've known what he did for Ali, she would be proud of him for sure.\n",
      "Kang Cheol/Hated by 1.1% of the fans: Sae-Byeok brother, doesn't like being in the orphanage, as the kids tell him that he will never leave it. Seong Gi-Hun did the right thing by taking him out of the orphanage. This potentially led to the audience giving Seong Gi-Hun more respect for him.\n",
      "Hwang Jun-Ho/Hated by 1.2% of the fans:  He was a detective trying to look for his brother. His brother disappeared when he went to the death games and Hwang Jun-ho noticed his disappearance. I felt really bad for him when he didn't realize that his brother was the Front Man all along of Squid Game. Let's all hope Hwang Jun-Ho comes back in Season 2.\n",
      "No.324/Hated by 1.3% of the fans: He was the first player to die in Squid Game. He didn't know that if you lost the game, you would die. It was a shame to see this person die way too quick. We probably could've gotten more character development from No.324 if he lived longer in the games.\n",
      "No.250/Hated by 1.3% of the fans: He was the second player to die in Squid Game. After seeing if Number 324 is messing around, he realizes that he got killed.

Because she watched episode 1-4 and she didn’t watch any longer because the harvesting organs and s** scene.

Please look down on me with pity and forgiveness. I pray for those who have sacrificed themselves for me or forgive them as well. Hear me, Oh Lord, help me and forgive me for what I have done and what I may do. I live with my heart only by your graces. I am your humble servant, and I seek repentance for my sins.

But how she entered the game? For me, I think she overheard somewhere about the salesman guy and a debtor (which gender-wise doesnt matter) about playing more games to earn loads of money (which is how Squid Game works) . He/she then won the salesman minigame, Ddakji, and got a 100K won and a business card in the end. Sae-Byeok then steals her money AND the business card together, like how she steals the money from Gi-Hun and the broker (which helps north koreans to escape north korea) she met. \n",

The Salesman (I got a theory it's that Seong Gi-Hun actually catches up to him when he gets off the train and beats him up and gets him to talk about where to track down tbe games he pretends to play along but he has a knife behind his back similar to the solider who tried to stab beyong gi the doctor but surprise Hwang jun-ho saves gi hun and they take the recruiter with them.)\n",

      "7. The Guards (I can say that I think that Seong Gi-Hun will find out along with Hwang Jun-ho how the types of guards are chosen because the guards based on numbers who died in season 1 will be replaced with new guards and they find out how it's done.)\n",

      "Hello! Let's talk about the deaths of the squid games, 456 people decided to compete in a risky survival game with childhood games, like Red Light Green Light! but the twist is death if you fail.\n",
      "Let's start with the first one who died:\n",
      "Player 324, a funny but pretty clueless guy. He was having fun. Made a bet, that was because he didn't know Failure = Death. So 455 players remain.\n",
      "Player 250. He was 324's \"friend\". He was the person 324 made a bet with. He smiled when he got eliminated, but his smile dropped when he heard a gunshot as 324 dropped on the ground. 250 thought he was just acting but realised a little bit later when he started coughing up blood. When 250 realised this. He started running. This is where it goes downhill… 454 players remain.\n",
      "After 250 died, Many people started running backwards trying to get out. As expected, many people died at this moment. Nice job to the people who knew they shouldn't have moved. I feel bad for the people who had to clean that.. Half of the game has been wiped out by this point. \n",
      "Just because people know not to move during an unexpected and chaotic moment doesn't mean it's impossible to still survive! About some people died after the wipeout.\n",
      "That's Red Light Green Light done! 201 players remain. Wow, that's a lot of deaths. Now we are moving onto the vote\n",
      "People voted to get out of the games or if they wanted to stay. Get Out won the vote. Everyone got out but mostly everyone decided to come back. Out of 201, 187 returned. Which means 14 decided not to return. 187 players remain, Moving onto Sugar Honeycombs. \n",
      "This was a game where you had to cut out a shape from a cookie with a needle. The shape you picked from the 4 options would be the shape you picked out. It could be a triangle, circle, star, or umbrella. Some people did not survive this though.\n",
      "After 369 died. Things went downhill quickly.\n",
      "People like these girls died. Then time ran out and tens of people died. 108 players remain, moving onto the lobby. \n",
      "When everyone was getting food, Suddenly the eggs ran out before everyone got one. The egg carton had just the right amount, 198 then snitched on Deok-su's team, saying they took more than 1 egg.\n",
      "Player 271, 271 went to his team and asked Deok-su for his egg. Deok-su refused so 271 tried to fight him for the egg and Deok-su ended up dropping his bottle. Which made him mad. He started kicking 271 until he died. \n",
      "Later on, the lights turned off. 198 wasn't sleeping and kept her eyes open. Deok-su was sneaking to her bed and killed her. 198 started screaming loud which woke up Gi-hun. This is the start of the riot and the flashing lights. People started murdering eachother and stuff. Breaking necks, broken bottles, and more gruesome things. Then, Il-nam started screaming for help and the Front Man stopped the fight. Coincidentally, 80 people now remain.\n",
      "With that done, Tug of War started but before they knew what game it was, they had to pick teams in 8 teams of 10. Gi-hun got the gang and brought more people like 244, the religious guy. Teams and more teams were made. Deok-su had his whole gang on the team and betrayed Mi-nyeo. This will be important later. So when the teams were made, they told the players what game it was. So, the guards would pick out a number. That number considering the team would go and do it.\n",
      " \n",
      "Team 7, a team with only extras was put up against Team 1, which was the team with Deok-su and his gang. As expected, Team 1 wins. and everyone in Team 7 is eliminated. 70 players remain.\n",
      "Then more teams died, and more. Team 1, 4, 3, and 6 survived. (probably) 40 players remain. Lets move onto.. wait, hold on, a cheater? he got executed?\n",
      "Byeong-gi (111) died because he was cheating. So 39 players remain, but wait. That's uneven! We can't do Marbles without an even amount!\n",
      "Guess who didn't get a partner and automatically passed it? That's right! Its our girlboss, Mi-myeo! I think she slept through the whole thing. Anyways…\n",
      "People died, obviously, but there was one death that made EVERYONE cry. It was Ali's betrayal from Sang-woo, who just wanted to live. You may know that…\n",
      "There is also 2 other deaths that made everyone cry, 1 was a teardrop waste, and the other one was truly sad. Anyways moving on, 17 players remain… maybe.\n",
      "After 070 died, 069 has been crying about it ever since. Sang-woo tried to make him shut up, but he failed. Something happens after that. Lights go off.\n",
      "Player 069 commits suicide with a white, slightly thick rope hanging from the bed climbing stairs. Everyone gets shocked and he gets eliminated. Let's move on now. 16 players remain.\n",
      "Everyone had to choose an apron with a number on it, between 1-16.\n",
      "Deok-su gets the 9 apron, 244 gets the 6 apron, Mi-nyeo gets the 11 apron. Gi-hun is about to get the 1 apron but 096 asks him for it because he wants to be in front of everyone. The game starts and 096 realises how screwed he is.\n",
      "The game starts and everyone gets 16 minutes, people are nervous.\n",
      "Then, people start falling and then it's 062's turn. (number 3)\n",
      "He calculated the chance of him getting all 15 rows correct. He tries it and gets 3 right, this made everyone confused since he did it so quick.\n",
      "Player 453. When it was 21's turn, (number 4) he asked her which way he went. She says she thinks he went left first, but he went right, right, left. 244 then says he actually went right, THEN left. but 21 trusted 453, which lead to his death.\n",
      "About a couple of minutes later, It's Deok-su's turn now. (number 9) He refuses to go and Min-tae (322) tries to get him off, but he was pushed by Mi-nyeo and Deok-su captured him and then threw him off.\n",
      "This is when Mi-nyeo approaches Deok-su. Remember when I said Deok-su betrayed Mi-nyeo and kicked her out of the gang? Well, it's important now.\n",
      "Mi-nyeo decides to commit suicide, but not just herself. She grabbed onto Deok-su and starting leaning backwards. Deok-su started demanding her to let go and let him survive, but she decided to kill both of them anyway.\n",
      "Now we have the glassmaker, Jung-soo. He knew which one was stronger than the other by lighting and refraction. He got one right but that is when they turned off the lights which means he couldn't check what the lighting was. Then, he asked for anything he could throw. Gi-hun then noticed he had a marble, he passed it on and Sang-woo gave it to Jung-soo and he threw it on the right one, but he still needed something else to throw at the wrong one so he could tell which one was correct. Before he could get something, Sang-woo decided to push him.\n",
      "Leading to his death, and that means Sae-byeok, Sang-woo, and Gi-hun are the only one's left. 3 players remain. They all finish the game and after that, they have a dinner for some reason, but before that, Sae-byeok got attacked by a flying glass piece, which lead to bad stuff.\n",
      "They had a dinner but when Gi-hun wasn't there, Sang-woo attacked Sae-byeok and stabbed her in the neck. Which resulted to death. Gi-hun then notices her dead, and knew it was Sang-woo. 2 players remain. Time for the final game. \n",
      "Squid Game, the game Gi-hun and Sang-woo played as kids. Now, as maybe enemies. They both get knives and have to play Squid Game with them. Gi-hun runs and Sang-woo runs and the game starts. They start attacking each other and Sang-woo tried stabbing him but Gi-hun stopped it with his hand which resulted a big cut through his hand, After. Sang-woo stabbed himself in the throat and died. Which made Gi-hun the winner of the squid games…\n",
      "Then, he went to a hairdresser and the hairdresser gave him red hair. THE END.\n",

      "Hi, everyone. Today I will be showing you my probability comparison of the Squid Game characters that people less to most likely hate. This will be only judged based on the character(including side characters) actions on the show. \n",
      "Abdul Ali/Hated by 0.1% of the fans: This character had to be the nicest person on the show. It was very sad to see Ali die because of Cho Sang-Woo betraying him in the marbles game. This led to Cho Sang-Woo being the most hated character on the show.  \n",
      "Seong Gi-Hun/Hated by 0.3% of the fans: He is the main character of the series. I feel bad for how he lost his childhood friend in the final episode of Season 1. Even if his friend was a traitor, no one deserves to lose their close ones. To make matters worse, his mother also passed away. I hope things will work out for Seong Gi-Hun in Season 2.\n",
      "Kang Sae-Byeok/Hated by 0.3% of the fans: She was so cute and her moments on the show were amazing. The way she died was very sad and probably made people hate Cho Sang-Woo even more. \n",
      "Seong Ga-Yeong/Hated by 0.5% of the fans: Seong Gi-Hun's daughter may not have gotten a lot of screen time on the show, but she was very adorable. Seong Gi-Hun is lucky to have such a nice daughter. I hope she makes another appearance in Season 2. \n",
      "Ji-Yeong/Hated by 0.8% of the fans: She sacrificed herself just so that Kang Sae-Byeok could live and make it to the finals. It's very devastating that she had a sad backstory and most people probably cried seeing her get shot by one of the soldiers. We will always honour her for what she did for Kang Sae-Byeok. \n",
      "Sang-Woo's Mother/Hated by 1% of the fans: It was very sad that she didn't know the situation his son was in.\n",
      "Kang Cheol/Hated by 1.1% of the fans: Sae-Byeok brother, doesn't like being in the orphanage, as the kids tell him that he will never leave it. Seong Gi-Hun did the right thing by taking him out of the orphanage. This potentially led to the audience giving Seong Gi-Hun more respect for him.\n",
      "Hwang Jun-Ho/Hated by 1.2% of the fans: I felt really bad for Hwang Jun-Ho when he didn't realize that his brother was the Front Man all along of Squid Game. Let's all hope Hwang Jun-Ho comes back in Season 2. \n",
      "No.324/Hated by 1.3% of the fans: He was the first player to die in Squid Game. He didn't know that if you lost the game, you would die. It was a shame to see this person die way too quick. We probably could've gotten more character development from No.324 if he lived longer in the games.\n",
      "Gi-Hun's Mom/Hated by 1.4% of the fans: A very hardworking mother, who unfortunately fell ill and died while Seong Gi-Hun was in the games. \n",
      "No.69 and No.70/Hated by 1.5% of the fans: A couple who had to play against each other in the game of marbles. The man won and that caused his wife to get eliminated. After that event happen, he decided to commit suicide by hanging himself. This had to be the most depressing death we ever saw on this show. I felt bad for the couple and they should have not have gone out like that.\n",
      "Death Guard/Hated by 2% of the fans: After when a random player broke his honeycomb that looked like an umbrella, the player decided to take a guard's revolver and take a guard hostage with that same gun. The player then forced him to remove his mask, and he followed his command. The guard looked young, and the player felt terrible about his choice. After that, the player killed himself with the revolver. The guard then got killed because he showed his face to one of the players. None of us barely knew anything about this guard, so nobody knew how to feel about him.\n",
      "Hair Stylist/Hated by 4% of the fans: Although she comes out for a very short time, she is the one responsible for making Seong-Gi Hun have red hair at the end of the series. \n",
      "Kim Sang-Hyuk/Hated by 8% of the fans: When Seong Gi-Hun tries to explain what happened to him, the policeman thinks he is very drunk and decides to ignore him.\n",
      "Kim Jin-Woo/Hated by 8% of the fans: This is another cop who didn't believe Seong Gi-Hun's story. \n",
      "The Salesman/Hated by 10% of the fans: This was a small but memorable role of The Salesman, who later convinces Gi-Hun and other players to join Squid Game. At the end of the series, we see him again. Seong Gi-Hun tries to talk to him, but he was too late as he was already on the train. \n",
      "Banker/Hated by 14% of the fans: He tries to convince Seong Gi-Hun to invest his money so he can earn more.\n",
      "Byeong-Gi/Hated by 18% of the fans: He was a doctor who used his expertise to try and get ahead in the death game. This later cost him and caused his death for cheating and not playing fair. \n",
      "The Doll/Hated by 20% of the fans: Although it is a robot that has killed many people, the doll is one of the icons of the series. \n",
      "Gi-Hun's Ex-Wife/Hated by 25% of the fans: Her decision, that she made to go with her new husband to the United States, leaving Seong Gi-Hun, only made people hate her even more.\n",
      "The Guards/Hated by 35% of the fans: Even if they kill without any mercy, they only do it to save themselves from ever being killed. For that reason, they are not higher on the list.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gi-Hun's Ex-Wife's Husband/Hated by 40% of the fans: He tried to pay Seong Gi-Hun away from his family, which people probably hated a lot. \n",
      "Han Mi-Nyeo/Hated by 42% of the fans: Her attitude towards many people in the games made many people hate her. However, Han Mi-Nyeo was able to get some love as she caused the death of Jang Deok-Su. I'm glad karma finally got to him and I think we can all agree that his death was satisfying on the show. \n",
      "Surgery Room Guard/Hated by 45% of the fans: He and the other guards tried to sell organs of the dead ones to earn money.\n",
      "Gang Member/Hated by 48% of the fans: He betrays Jang Deok-Su by handing him over to his enemies(Jang Deok-Su manages to escape by jumping from a bridge).\n",
      "No.278/Hated by 57% of the fans: He was next to Jang Deok-Su until he had to play the marbles against him, and he was able to almost kill Jang Deok-Su. But thankfully, Han Mi-Nyeo was able to finish the job herself.\n",
      "Oh ll-Nam/Hated by 69% of the fans: The end of the series potentially made many hate the old man. He was the creator of Squid Game this entire time. The main reason he participated in the games was that he is dying due to a brain tumour. He just wanted to experience the games as a player before he died. People speculated that he was safe during the games. I might have to look more into that later.\n",
      "Factory Owner/Hated by 72% of the fans: He rips off Abdul Ali as he does not pay him for his work in the factory. This was not fair and it just shows that people can be like this nowadays. I feel bad that Ali had to go through that nonsense for no reason. I'm glad Ali's boss got his hand crushed. You just have to love karma.\n",
      "No.40/Hated by 73% of the fans: He stands next to Jang Deok-Su and does everything he says. I have no respect for this guy whatsoever.\n",
      "Loan Shark/Hated by 75% of the fans: He threatens Seong Gi-Hun because of his debt and he caused Seong Gi-Hun to play the games. \n",
      "Jang Deok-Su/Hated by 89% of the fans: He just wanted to live and did not care about taking any lives of others to achieve it. I'm glad he got what he deserved and we can all thank Han Mi-Nyeo for that once again. \n",
      "Cho Sang-Woo/Hated by 98% of the fans: Many people started to like him until he caused the death of Abdul Ali. On top of that, he also finishes Kang Sae-byeok by using his knife. This happened while Seong Gi-Hun was distracted asking for help to Kang Sae-byeok. This caused most of the fans to hate Cho Sang-Woo and I agree with them. \n",
      "The VIPs/Hated by 99.5% of the fans: Rich people who only care about their lives and pay to see others suffer and die. These people have to be the most disgusting characters on Squid Game. The VIPs are nothing, but selfish pricks who don't deserve any mercy from anyone. \n",
      "Front Man(Hwang In-Ho)/Hated by 99.9% of the fans: The enigmatic masked leader of Squid Game. He shot his own brother without any mercy at all. Hwang Jun-Ho didn't deserve that and he did all of this just for In-Ho. \n",
      "That is my list of hated characters from lowest to highest. I hope you guys enjoyed reading this and let me know if you agree with some of my opinions or not. Thanks! :)\n",

      "In Episode 3 (\"The Man with the Umbrella), Gi-hun (contestant No. 456) tries to wake up Il-nam who is laying on a bed. Upon seeing the old man wake up.\n",
      "In the series finale (\"One Lucky Day\"), the pair meet again in the same scenario, with Gi-hun overlooking Il-nam on a bed before the old man takes his last breath.\n",

      "In the second episode (\"Hell\"), following a majority vote to end the competition, the players return to their lives and are met by the realities of their desperate situations, including Sang-woo (contestant No. 218, played by Park Hae-soo), a securities firm worker with an overwhelming amount of debt who is wanted by police for various investment-related scandals.\n",
      "The episode sees Sang-woo attempt to take his own life at his apartment before he is interrupted by the doorbell ringing, with only a business card (the same one every contestant was given when they were recruited for the competition) slipped under the door. Sang-woo later goes on to become a contest finalist, making it to the Squid Game round, the last game of the competition.

      "When she realizes the broker has been conning her, the fearless contestant holds a knife to his neck, threatening to kill him if he cons her again.\n",
      "Fast forward to episode no. 8 (\"Front Man\"), Sae-byeok is stabbed to death by Sang-woo in the players' quarters, using a dinner knife that he (as well as Sae-byeok and Gi-hun) was allowed to hold onto following a special meal served to congratulate the finalists for making it to the last round.\n",
